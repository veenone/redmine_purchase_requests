# ✅ ISSUE RESOLUTION - FINAL STATUS REPORT

## 🎯 Problem Resolved Successfully

### **Primary Issue**: JSON Parsing Errors in Redmine Asset Pipeline
```
ActionView::Template::Error (unexpected token at '')
JSON::ParserError (unexpected token at '')
```

### **Root Cause Identified**:
The error was caused by **corrupted or malformed asset compilation** in Redmine's asset pipeline, affecting both core Redmine functionality and our plugin.

## 🔧 Solution Applied

### **Step 1: Asset Pipeline Reset**
```bash
cd /opt/redmine
bundle exec rake assets:clobber RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### **Step 2: Asset Loading Optimization**
- Disabled global hooks that could interfere with asset loading
- Implemented direct asset includes in individual view files
- Ensured proper content_for blocks in all views

### **Step 3: Verification and Testing**
- All pages now load successfully with 200 OK responses
- No more JSON parsing errors in logs
- CAPEX functionality fully operational
