# ðŸŽ‰ CAPEX Implementation - Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem Solved âœ…

### **Issue**: JSON Parsing Errors in Asset Pipeline
- **Error**: `ActionView::Template::Error (unexpected token at ''): JSON::ParserError`
- **Root Cause**: Global hooks loading assets on every page, causing conflicts with Redmine's core asset pipeline
- **Impact**: Affecting both plugin pages and core Redmine functionality

### **Solution Implemented**:

1. **Disabled Global Asset Hooks**
   - Removed `view_layouts_base_html_head` hook that was loading assets globally
   - Prevented conflicts with Redmine's core asset loading

2. **Implemented Direct Asset Loading**
   - Added `content_for :header_tags` blocks to individual view files
   - Each view now loads only the assets it specifically needs
   - More reliable and targeted asset loading approach

3. **Asset Distribution**:
   ```ruby
   # CAPEX Views:
   - capex.css + purchase_requests.css
   - capex.js + purchase_requests.js
   - apexcharts.js (dashboard only)

   # Purchase Request Views:
   - purchase_requests.css + purchase_request_buttons.css
   - purchase_requests.js
   - apexcharts.js (dashboard only)
   ```

## Current Status âœ…

### **Working Functionality**:
- âœ… Project pages load without JSON errors
- âœ… CAPEX management fully operational
- âœ… Purchase Request integration working
- âœ… CAPEX dashboard with charts functional
- âœ… All CRUD operations working
- âœ… Asset loading optimized and stable

### **Files Updated**:
```
âœ… lib/redmine_purchase_requests/hooks.rb - Hook system simplified
âœ… app/views/capex/*.html.erb - Asset includes added
âœ… app/views/purchase_requests/*.html.erb - Asset includes added
âœ… All functionality preserved and enhanced
```

## Technical Resolution Details

### **Before (Problematic)**:
```ruby
# Global hook affecting all pages
render_on :view_layouts_base_html_head, partial: 'hooks/purchase_requests/includes'
```

### **After (Solution)**:
```ruby
# Direct asset loading in each view
<% content_for :header_tags do %>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'purchase_requests', plugin: 'redmine_purchase_requests' %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'purchase_requests', plugin: 'redmine_purchase_requests' %>
<% end %>
```

## Benefits of New Approach

1. **No Global Conflicts**: Assets only load when needed
2. **Better Performance**: Reduced asset loading overhead
3. **Maintainable**: Clear dependency management per view
4. **Stable**: No interference with core Redmine functionality
5. **Flexible**: Easy to add/remove assets per page

## Final Verification âœ…
