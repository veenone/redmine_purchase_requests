# Priority Distribution Chart Fix

## Issue Fixed
The priority distribution in the purchase requests dashboard was only showing as a table without a visual chart, unlike the status distribution which had both a pie chart and table.

## Solution Implemented
Added a native SVG pie chart for priority distribution that matches the existing status distribution chart implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Priority Distribution Card
**Before**: Only displayed a table with priority counts
**After**: Added visual pie chart with legend and enhanced table

### 2. Chart Structure Added
- **Chart Container**: `chart-pie-container` with SVG chart area
- **Chart Legend**: Color-coded legend showing priority levels with counts and percentages
- **Enhanced Table**: Added percentage column to match status distribution

### 3. JavaScript Chart Generation
Added JavaScript call to generate the priority distribution pie chart using the existing `generatePieChart` function:

```javascript
generatePieChart('priority-pie-chart', [
  // Priority data with colors:
  // Urgent: #f44336 (Red)
  // High: #ff9800 (Orange)  
  // Normal: #4caf50 (Green)
  // Low: #2196f3 (Blue)
]);
```

### 4. Color Scheme
- **Urgent**: Red (#f44336) - Highest priority
- **High**: Orange (#ff9800) - High priority
- **Normal**: Green (#4caf50) - Standard priority
- **Low**: Blue (#2196f3) - Low priority

### 5. Data Handling
- **Conditional Display**: Chart only shows when there's data (`@priority_distribution.values.sum > 0`)
- **No Data State**: Shows "No data" message when no priorities are available
- **Filtering**: Only includes priorities with count > 0 in the chart data

## Features Added

### ✅ **Visual Pie Chart**
- Native SVG pie chart matching status distribution design
- Interactive hover effects with scaling
- Color-coded segments for each priority level

### ✅ **Enhanced Legend**
- Shows priority name, count, and percentage
- Color indicators matching chart segments
- Clean, readable format

### ✅ **Improved Table**
- Added percentage column for better insight
- Color indicators for each priority level
- Consistent styling with status distribution

### ✅ **Data Validation**
- Checks for data existence before rendering
- Handles empty states gracefully
- Only includes non-zero priorities in chart

## Technical Details

### Chart Implementation
- Uses existing `generatePieChart` JavaScript function
- SVG-based rendering for scalability
- Consistent styling with status distribution chart

### Data Flow
1. **Controller**: Calculates `@priority_distribution` and `@priority_percentages`
2. **View**: Renders chart container and table
3. **JavaScript**: Generates interactive SVG pie chart
4. **Display**: Shows visual chart with legend and detailed table

### Responsive Design
- Chart adapts to container size
- Legend wraps appropriately
- Table remains readable on all screen sizes

## Files Modified
- `/opt/redmine/plugins/redmine_purchase_requests/app/views/purchase_requests/dashboard.html.erb`

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to: http://172.17.86.242/projects/{project_id}/purchase_requests/dashboard
2. **Verify Priority Distribution Chart**:
   - Check that pie chart is displayed
   - Verify legend shows all priority levels with correct colors
   - Test hover effects on chart segments
   - Confirm table shows counts and percentages
3. **Test with Different Data**:
   - Create purchase requests with different priorities
   - Verify chart updates accordingly
   - Check that empty states are handled properly

## Benefits

### ✅ **Visual Consistency**
- Priority distribution now matches status distribution design
- Consistent user experience across dashboard cards

### ✅ **Better Data Visualization**
- Easy to see priority distribution at a glance
- Color coding helps identify patterns quickly
- Interactive elements improve user engagement

### ✅ **Enhanced Analytics**
- Percentages provide better insight into data distribution
- Visual representation makes trends more apparent
- Complements existing tabular data

### ✅ **Improved Dashboard**
- More engaging and professional appearance
- Better utilization of dashboard space
- Consistent chart implementation across all cards

## Result
The priority distribution now displays as a complete visualization with:
- ✅ **Interactive pie chart** showing priority breakdown
- ✅ **Color-coded legend** with counts and percentages  
- ✅ **Enhanced table** with percentage column
- ✅ **Consistent design** matching status distribution
- ✅ **Proper data handling** for empty states
